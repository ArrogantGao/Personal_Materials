Title: 
Fast Summation Algorithms and Tensor Network Methods for Scientific Applications

Abstract: 
This presentation will introduce two numerical algorithms.
One is a fast summation algorithm for calculating the Coulomb interaction in quasi-2D charged systems, which utilizes the sum-of-Gaussian approximation of the Coulomb kernel and the kernel splitting technique. This approach addresses challenges arising from singularities and strong confinement.
The other is an algorithm that automatically discovers the optimal branching rules for the maximum independent set problem based on tensor network methods. Its efficiency enables us to generate the branching rules on-the-fly, which is provably optimal and reduces the number of branches compared to existing methods that rely on expert-designed branching rules.
